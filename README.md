# Cambridge University Computing and Technology Society

## About Us

CUCaTS is the primary society within the University of Cambridge for those interested in Computer Science and Technology. We aim to provide a platform for students to explore and engage with technology, regardless of their degree or experience level. The society runs both its own events/programmes and provides resources and funding to those who want to do the same.
